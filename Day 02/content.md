## What is JSX & Why JSX Came into Picture 

JSX stands for JavaScript XML, and it is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript files. JSX is mainly used with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

JSX came into the picture because it makes it easier to write and read code when working with React components. It allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript files, which makes it easier to understand the structure of your components.

JSX also provides a simple way to write components that are easy to reuse and maintain. With JSX, you can write components that are self-contained, which makes it easier to test and debug your code.

## Integrating JSX with React

To use JSX with React, you need to install React and a package that enables Babel to compile JSX code. Here are the steps to integrate JSX with React:

1. Install React and ReactDOM using npm:

```
npm install react react-dom
```

2. Install Babel and the necessary presets:

```
npm install babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-env babel-preset-react --save-dev
```

3. Create a new React component in a .jsx file and use JSX syntax to define the component's markup:

```
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World!</h1>
      <p>This is my first React component.</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

4. Create an entry point for your React application (e.g., index.js) and render your component using ReactDOM.render():

```
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

ReactDOM.render(<MyComponent />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

5. Configure Babel to transpile JSX syntax by adding a .babelrc file to your project:

```
{
  "presets": ["env", "react"]
}
```

6. Run your project using a development server like webpack or create-react-app:

```
npm start
```

That's it! You can now use JSX syntax to define your React components and have them transpiled to standard JavaScript syntax using Babel.

## 

Babel is a JavaScript compiler that converts modern JavaScript code into a version of JavaScript that is compatible with older browsers and environments. Babel is also used to compile JSX code into React elements.

The purpose of Babel is to allow developers to use the latest features of JavaScript without worrying about browser compatibility. Babel takes code written in modern JavaScript syntax and transpiles it into a version that can be run in older browsers.

When Babel encounters JSX code, it converts it into a series of function calls that create React elements. Here's an example of how Babel converts JSX into React elements:

```
// JSX code
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;

// Transpiled code
const element = React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello, world!");
```

In the transpiled code, the JSX syntax is converted into a function call to React.createElement(), which creates a React element. The first argument to React.createElement() is the name of the element (in this case, "h1"), the second argument is any attributes the element has (in this case, there are no attributes), and the third argument is the element's children (in this case, the text "Hello, world!").

Babel uses the React.createElement() function to create a tree of React elements based on the JSX code. This tree is what React uses to render the component.
