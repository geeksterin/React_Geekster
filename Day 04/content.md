## Develop Static Website using React Component Concept Without Reusing the Components

Developing a static website using React components can be a great way to create a scalable, modular website that is easy to maintain and update. To do this without reusing components, you will need to create each component individually and add them to the appropriate page. Here are the steps you can follow to create a static website using React components:

- Set up your development environment: To develop a React application, you will need to have Node.js and a code editor installed on your computer. You can create a new React project using tools like create-react-app, which will set up a basic project structure for you.

- Define your components: Before you can start building your website, you will need to define the components that you will use. Each component should be a separate file, and should include a class or function that returns the component's JSX. You can use CSS or inline styles to style your components.

- Create your pages: Once you have defined your components, you can start creating your pages. Each page should be a separate file, and should include the components that you want to display on that page. You can use React Router to create routes for your pages.

- Add your components to your pages: To display your components on your pages, you will need to import them into the page file and render them in the page's JSX. You can pass data to your components as props to customize their behavior.

- Test and deploy your website: Once you have finished building your website, you can test it locally using a development server. When you are ready to deploy your website, you can use tools like Netlify or GitHub Pages to host your website.

By following these steps, you can create a static website using React components without reusing any components. While this approach can be more time-consuming than reusing components, it allows you to have more control over the layout and functionality of each page on your website.
