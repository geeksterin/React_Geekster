### TextUtils Application is a web-based application developed using ReactJS and state management. This application allows users to modify and manipulate text data in various ways. Users can enter text in the input box, and then the application provides a range of options to manipulate the text.

- The TextUtils Application has several features that allow users to perform different tasks on text data. These features include:

- Text case conversion: The application allows users to convert the text to uppercase, lowercase, or capitalize the first letter of each word.

- Remove extra spaces: The application removes any additional spaces between the text, ensuring that there is only one space between each word.

- Count characters and words: The application counts the number of characters and words in the text entered by the user.

- Copy to clipboard: The application provides the option to copy the modified text to the clipboard.

To implement these features, we use the ReactJS library and state management. The application consists of a single page with an input box for text and a set of buttons to perform different operations.
