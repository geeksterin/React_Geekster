Password Generator app is a web-based application developed using ReactJS library. This application is used to generate strong and secure passwords for users. It is a very useful tool that can be used to create complex passwords that are difficult to guess.

The Password Generator app consists of a single page with an input box to specify the length of the password and a set of checkboxes to specify the types of characters that should be included in the password. The types of characters include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

When the user enters the length of the password and selects the desired character types, the application generates a random password that satisfies the user's criteria. The user can then copy the password to the clipboard and use it to secure their accounts.

To implement this functionality, we use the ReactJS library and state management. The application consists of a form with input fields and checkboxes that are used to specify the password requirements. When the user enters the length of the password, the state is updated to store the value entered by the user. Similarly, when the user selects the checkboxes, the state is updated to store the selected options.

When the user clicks on the "Generate Password" button, the application generates a random password that satisfies the user's criteria. The password is then displayed on the screen, and the user can copy it to the clipboard using the "Copy to Clipboard" button.

In summary, the Password Generator app is a useful tool that provides an easy way to generate strong and secure passwords for users. The application is built using ReactJS and state management, and it is easy to use and highly customizable.
